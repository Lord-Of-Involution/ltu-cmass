# cmass-ili
A repository for storing code for the LtU Express Go Big pipeline. The scripts in this repository are designed to simulate and analyze mocks of the CMASS NGC galaxy sample from the BOSS survey.

## Organization
The repository is organized into three main directories: `simulation`, `summaries`, and `tools`. The `simulation` directory contains scripts for generating mock catalogs of the CMASS NGC sample. The `summaries` directory contains scripts for calculating informative summaries from the survey mocks. The `tools` directory contains software used to support various parts of the forward modeling pipeline.
